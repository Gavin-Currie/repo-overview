# repo-overview
An overview of how I'll structure my GitHub repo's   

### Adding a default feedback Branch   
For the first few repo's I submit, I'll need feedback and peer reviews on how to improve my code within my repo's.   
I'll add a feedback branch to my repo's, so if you want to help improve my code, do a fork, then make whatever changes and improvments in the feedback branch,   
then make a pull request, then I'll check it out and make whatever merges that look good.   
Thanks.
